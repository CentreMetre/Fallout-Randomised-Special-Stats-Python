This programme simply generates a random amount of points per special stat according to the game that the user chooses. The user choise is important since the game have different maximum/assignable S.P.E.C.I.A.L points.

The programme asks the user what game they want, out of a chouse of Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, or Fallout 4. Then the programme generates the points for each S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat, which the user can then use in the game.

Technical documentation
Because I don't know how to make pythons random function make sure the generated numbers equal a certain total, I have to either add or remove the points after they get assigned to the list.
